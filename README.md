## TODOs

- [ ] current slice is a array of strings, change it to something that can hold the filepath and hash
- [ ] as soon as a file is known to be a duplicate move it to another folder and protocol its old and new path the console
- [ ] create a parameter if the protocol should be written to disk
- [ ] create a parameter if all duplicates should be deleted and not archived
- [ ] remove all debugging outputs (maybe quiet/debug flag)
- [ ] output every processed folder/file in one line and update that line (if that's even possible?)
- [ ] create a proper error handling

## Later Version

- [ ] check if a found image is a meme and archive or delete it
